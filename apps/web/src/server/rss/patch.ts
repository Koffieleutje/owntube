/**
 * Correct a list of a channel's videos against that channel's uploads RSS.
 *
 * Invidious' channel listing does not carry real publish dates: it derives
 * `published` from YouTube's coarse relative text ("2 weeks ago") at request
 * time, so every row in one response shares the same time-of-day and is only
 * accurate to the granularity of that text. When the text itself degenerates
 * ("0 seconds ago") the video lands on *now*, which reads as "just uploaded"
 * and keeps resetting every time the cache refreshes. The same rows sometimes
 * report `viewCount: 0` for a video with hundreds of thousands of views.
 *
 * Measured against James Hoffmann's channel (2026-09-05): the listing dated
 * `Iq34gq2ihMk` to that minute with 0 views, while both the RSS feed and the
 * single-video endpoint put it at 2026-07-16 with ~414k views.
 *
 * RSS is authoritative for both fields and covers a channel's ~15 newest
 * uploads — exactly the head of a subscriptions feed or a channel page.
