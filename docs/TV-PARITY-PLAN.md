Already shipped before this plan: device pairing, session-expiry → sign-in
and Search D-pad focus (`f051369`), faster browsing and playback in `Shell`,
`VideoRow`, `CarouselFeed`, `HomeScreen` and `WatchScreen` (`fffcb77`), Back
in the player hiding the controls first (`b88b313`), pairing-code
auto-refresh (`8a8eb0e`) and live via `/dash/<id>/live.mpd` (`8e1a1e1`).
Phase 0 starts from `main` at `8e1a1e1`.

## The question this answers

How far should `apps/tv` go toward the web app and toward the official YouTube
Android TV client, and in what order?

The answer from a feature inventory of both apps: **the TV app is good at
starting a video and weak at everything after it.** It has sign-in, home,
subscriptions with tags, search with voice, channels, history, queue,
playlists, settings, and a player with server DASH, audio language, chapters,
storyboard scrubbing, SponsorBlock and resume. What it lacks is the lean-back
loop (nothing happens when a video ends), most player controls, and every
Android TV platform hook the official client relies on.

Almost all of phases 1–3 is **client-only**: the tRPC procedures already exist
because the web app uses them.

## Non-goals

- **Touch/pointer features from the web:** swipe gestures, quick-action
  registry, mini-player, cinema mode, keyboard shortcuts, bottom-nav editor,
  theme/visual theme, drag reorder. A D-pad needs its own interaction models
  (below), not ports.
- **Editing server-level settings on the TV:** Invidious instances, RSS feeds,
  Takeout/JSON import-export, cache maintenance, taste onboarding. These stay
  web-only; the TV links to them via "Manage on web" (a QR code to the page).
- **Posting comments, live chat.** Read-only at most.
- **YouTube account features** (notifications, memberships, uploads). OwnTube
  has no such concepts.
- **A navigation library.** The `Shell` section + overlay stack is enough;
  phase 1 extends it with a "play context" rather than replacing it.

## Phase 0 — groundwork

Small, do first, one commit.

- Declare the transitive deps the app imports directly: `expo-keep-awake`,
  `expo-file-system`, `@expo/vector-icons` in `apps/tv/package.json`.
- Rewrite `apps/tv/README.md` (it still says "Phase 1 scaffold, not yet
  runtime-verified"); link the build/test recipe (Docker + emulator).
- Fix stale comments: `LoginScreen.tsx` ("pairing replaces this later"),
  `WatchScreen.tsx` `pickDefaultOptionIndex` doc ("HLS wins"; DASH is first).
- Remove the dead `src/lib/use-query.ts` hook; move `errorMessage` to its own
  module.
- Honour `settings.sponsorBlockCategories` instead of the hardcoded category
  list in `WatchScreen`. This is a bug, not a feature.

## Phase 1 — lean-back playback

The highest-value phase: it turns "open a video" into "watch TV".

### 1.1 Play context

Introduce a play context on the `watch` route:

```ts
type PlayContext =
  | { kind: "single" }
  | { kind: "queue" }                         // queue.listDetailed order
  | { kind: "playlist"; playlistId: string } // playlists.itemsDetailed order
  | { kind: "feed"; videoIds: string[] };     // the row the video came from
```

`nav.openVideo(videoId, { resumeSeconds, context })`. `WatchScreen` resolves
"next" and "previous" from the context, falling back to `video.related[0]`
for `single`.

### 1.2 Up next / autoplay

- Read `settings.autoplayNext` (currently fetched but never used on TV).
- On `playToEnd`: show an end screen with the next item and a 10 s countdown,
  "Play now" (focused) and "Cancel". Counting down only when `autoplayNext` is
  on; otherwise the card waits for OK.
- Remote `MEDIA_NEXT` / `MEDIA_PREVIOUS` (and long-press right/left at the
  end of the bar) move within the context.
- When the context is `queue`, remove the finished item (`queue.remove`),
  matching the web queue's consume behaviour. Check the web first; if it keeps
  items, keep them here too.

### 1.3 Play all

"Play all" buttons on `QueueScreen` and `PlaylistsScreen` start the context at
item 0 (or at the first unfinished item, using `history.progressAll`).

### 1.4 Continue watching

A row at the top of `HomeScreen`: videos from `history.progressAll` with
5 % < progress < 90 %, newest first, opened with their resume position. No
new procedure; `watch-progress.tsx` already loads the data.

**Verify:** on the emulator, play a 2-item playlist to the end with autoplay on
and off; next/previous keys; queue item consumed; continue-watching row
updates after backing out mid-video.

**As built:**
- The context is a snapshot of the list the video was started from
  (`PlayContext` in `lib/navigation.ts`); next/previous replace the route, so
  Back still returns to where playback began.
- Only a video opened without a context runs on into its first related
  video. A queue or playlist stops at its end.
- The queue isn't consumed on the client: `history.upsertEvent` with
  `completed` already removes the video from the queue on the server, and the
  player sends that on `playToEnd`.
- Previous restarts the video after its first 5 s, like a CD player.
- The long-press at the end of the bar was dropped: long left/right already
  hold-scrub.
- Verified on the emulator: the up-next card after a feed video, Play now,
  Previous, Play all on the queue, and the Continue watching row. Not
  exercised: queue consumption (to avoid editing the real queue) and the
  countdown (`autoplayNext` is off on the test account).

## Phase 2 — player controls

One **player settings panel** (opened with a gear button, or with DOWN from
the control row) instead of cycling buttons. Rows: Quality, Captions, Audio
language, Speed, Stats. Each row opens a vertical list; Back closes.

- **Quality.** Offer the DASH representations ExoPlayer exposes (expo-video
  `availableVideoTracks` / `videoTrack`, if the installed expo-video version
  supports it). Otherwise offer the existing source options (DASH Auto, muxed
  heights). Apply `defaultPlaybackQuality` as a max-height cap on the DASH
  source so the setting finally does something.
- **Captions.** List all subtitle tracks by language; remember the choice
  (local per-device, like the web's `player-captions` storage). Add a
  caption-size preference (S/M/L) if expo-video exposes styling; otherwise skip.
- **Audio language.** Move the globe cycle button into the panel as a list.
- **Speed.** 0.5–2× (same steps as the web's `player-constants.ts`).
- **Stats for nerds** (cheap and useful for debugging on real TVs): source id,
  resolution, codec, dropped frames, buffer.
- **Subscribe** button in the player's channel row (`subscriptions.status` /
  `add` / `remove`; copy the optimistic pattern from `ChannelScreen`).
- **Save to playlist** dialog: `playlists.list`, `playlists.membership`,
  `addItem` / `removeItem`, plus "New playlist" through `playlists.create`
  with a text field.
- **SponsorBlock UX:** a "Skipped: Sponsor" toast with a 5 s "Undo"; a
  "Skip sponsor" button when auto-skip is off; segment marks on the seek bar
  (the chapter tick renderer already exists).
- **Chapters list:** a panel row listing chapters; OK seeks.
- **Mark as watched** (`history.upsertEvent` completed / `subscriptions.markWatched`).

**Verify:** each panel row reachable and escapable with the D-pad only; the
quality choice survives a source fallback; captions choice persists across
videos.

**As built:**
- expo-video 2.0 exposes no video tracks, so Quality is a ceiling on the
  server DASH manifest: a new `maxHeight` query parameter on
  `/dash/<id>/manifest.mpd` (`capDashVideoHeight`). The ceiling goes by
  YouTube's rung label, so cinemascope 1920x804 counts as 1080p. Auto
  follows `defaultPlaybackQuality`. The fallback sources (HLS, MP4, split)
  are listed too. Older servers ignore the parameter.
- The panel (`components/MenuPanel.tsx`) is a generic drill-down list. Back
  steps out a page, and focus returns to the row that opened it.
- Captions: a per-device language preference, applied when the tracks
  appear. The CC button stays as a quick toggle. The globe button moved into
  the panel as "Audio language".
- Caption size was skipped: expo-video 2.0 has no styling API.
- Stats for nerds shows source, host, cap, status, buffer, speed, live and
  captions. Codec and dropped frames aren't exposed by expo-video 2.0.
- SponsorBlock:
  - Coloured segment marks on the bar.
  - "Skipped X · OK to undo" after an auto-skip.
  - "X · OK to skip" while inside a segment with auto-skip off.
  - OK only acts on the toast while the controls are hidden; with the
    controls up, it goes to the focused button.
- Verified on the emulator:
  - The panel pages.
  - Quality reaching the server (`maxHeight=480`).
  - English captions persisting to the next video.
  - Subscribe button present.
  - The skip toast and segment marks.
- Not verified: the undo press itself (the emulator decoder is too slow to
  time it reliably), and writes to real playlists, subscriptions or
  watched state.

## Phase 3 — browsing parity

- **Home from `settings.homeBlocks`.** Render the same blocks the web user
  configured (subscriptions, recommended, explore/trending, history, queue,
  saved, playlists, single playlist) as rows, keeping the hero on top.
  Unsupported layouts (sizes, rows) map to one row style. The web stays the
  editor; the TV shows a "Customise on web" hint.
- **Search:**
  - Suggestions from `search.suggestions`, shown beside the field and
    updated as you type or dictate.
  - Recent searches, stored locally.
  - Channel results with Subscribe, from the channels part of the web
    search results.
  - Sort by relevance, newest or views.
- **Subscriptions:** page past the 50-channel `listSidebar` cap (use
  `subscriptions.listDetailed`, or add a cursor to `listSidebar`), unsubscribe
  from a channel's context menu, and a new-video dot based on
  `refreshRecency`.
- **Channel tabs:** Videos, Shorts, Playlists and Similar
  (`channel.page` tab, `channel.playlists`, `channel.relatedChannels`), plus
  the tag chips (`channelTags.*`).
- **Library editing.** Add a long-press OK **context menu** as the one
  pattern used everywhere:
  - on a video card: Play, Add to queue, Save, Save to playlist, Mark
    watched, Not interested (`interactions.set` ignore), Go to channel
  - on library screens: Remove, Move up, Move down (`queue.reorder`,
    `playlists.reorderItems`), Clear queue, Remove from history
    (`history.softDelete`)
- **Saved and Trending sections** (`interactions.listSaved`, `trending.list`
  with region), added to the sidebar and to the sidebar editor.

**Verify:** a web user's `homeBlocks` changes show up on the TV after a
refresh; the context menu works on every card type; more than 50
subscriptions are reachable.

**As built:**
- Home:
  - The hero, then Continue watching, then one row per `homeBlocks` entry
    (`components/HomeBlockRow.tsx`), with the web's defaults and options
    (hideShorts, hideIgnored, tags, hideFinished, hideCompleted).
  - A "playlists" block plays a playlist on OK.
  - The footer points to the web for editing.
- Long-press OK: react-native-tvos only reports a held select key as a
  `longSelect` TV event (Pressable's onLongPress never fires, and the
  release still clicks). So the focused element registers its long-press
  action (`lib/long-press.ts`), one Shell handler runs it, and the release
  click is swallowed.
- The context menu (`components/CardMenu.tsx`):
  - Items: Play, add/remove queue, save/unsave, Save to playlist, Mark
    watched, Not interested, Don't recommend channel, Go to channel.
  - Screen extras: move up/down and Clear queue (with a confirm page) on
    Queue; remove and move up/down on Playlists; Remove from history.
  - `MenuPanel` traps focus with `TVFocusGuideView`.
  - "Save to playlist" pages are shared with the player (`lib/playlist-menu.tsx`).
- Subscriptions:
  - Every channel from `listDetailed`, sorted like the sidebar.
  - A dot for uploads in the last 3 days.
  - Long-press a channel for Open / Unsubscribe (with a confirm page).
- Channel page:
  - Videos, Shorts, Playlists (YouTube playlists; OK plays one through) and
    Similar tabs.
  - Tag chips toggle the user's existing tags. New tags are still made on
    the web.
- Search:
  - Suggestions (debounced) and recent searches (on the device) as chips.
  - A channel row (ChannelTiles).
  - Relevance, Newest and Most viewed sorts, done on the client as on the web.
- Saved and Trending sections. Sidebar prefs now store which sections they
  have seen, so new sections appear once for existing installs.
- Also in this phase:
  - Upstream's watch-progress recorder (`lib/record-watch-progress.ts`): the
    resume point is always sent, `durationWatched` is time actually played,
    and `channelName` is included.
  - `config.ts` reads the server URL at call time: groundwork for phase 4's
    server setting.
- Verified on the emulator: Home blocks, the card context menu (with focus
  trap and Back), Subscriptions with dots, the channel menu and channel page
  with tabs and tags, the Similar tab, and search with channels and sorts.
  Not exercised: menu actions that write (to keep the real account
  unchanged), and the suggestion chips.

## Phase 4 — distribution

Needed before the APK can go to anyone else.

- **Server URL setting:**
  - A first-run "Server" screen before sign-in, with a text field, an
    `auth.session` health check, and the value saved in SecureStore.
  - `config.ts` reads the stored URL first and falls back to
    `EXPO_PUBLIC_OWNTUBE_URL`.
  - Changing the server signs out.
  - Settings gets "Server: <url> · Change".
- **Versioning:**
  - `version` / `android.versionCode` in `app.json`, bumped per release.
  - Settings shows the version, build and server.
- **Updates:** either expo-updates (OTA JS updates served by OwnTube itself,
  e.g. `/tv/updates`) or a simpler "new APK available" check against a JSON
  file on the server plus a download link or QR code. Start with the
  simple check.
- **Release signing:** a real keystore (not the debug key) kept outside the
  repo; document it in the README.
- **CI:** a job that installs `apps/tv` on its own, typechecks with the web
  types resolvable, and runs `assembleRelease` for `arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a`,
  uploading the APK as an artifact.

**As built:**
- Server:
  - `ServerScreen` on a fresh install (no stored server and no token), or
    from Settings → Change server or the sign-in screen's corner button.
  - Connect checks `auth.session` answers with tRPC JSON, so a proxy's empty
    200 or an HTML page is rejected.
  - Changing server clears the token and the query cache.
  - The tRPC link targets a placeholder URL and `fetch` substitutes the
    current server, because tRPC wants a string when the link is built.
  - TVs that were already signed in keep their built-in server without
    being asked.
- Versioning: app.json 0.2.0 / versionCode 2. Settings → About shows the
  version, versionCode and `EXPO_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID`.
- Updates: the simple check.
  - The web serves `/tv/update.json` and `/tv/download/<file>.apk` from
    `$OWNTUBE_TV_RELEASES_DIR` (default `data/tv-releases`). Both 404
    until something is published.
  - Settings → About shows "Update available … <url>" when the published
    versionCode is higher.
- Signing: `plugins/with-release-signing.js` signs release builds with
  `OWNTUBE_TV_KEYSTORE` when set, otherwise the debug key as before. No
  keystore was created; see the README.
- CI: dropped. The repo carries no GitHub workflows (removed in `54a66d1`);
  build APKs with the Docker recipe in `apps/tv/README.md`.
- Verified on the emulator:
  - Settings shows the server and the version.
  - Change server → Server screen → Connect → sign-in, then pairing again.
  - The web routes return 404 while nothing is published, including a
    path-traversal attempt.
- Not verified: a published update being offered (nothing was published to
  the shared data dir), and the fresh-install path (the emulator still has
  its data).

## Phase 5 — Android TV platform

Where the official client is strongest. Each item is a config plugin or small
native module, following the pattern of `plugins/with-tv-search.js`.

- **Deep links:**
  - `owntube://watch?v=<id>&t=<s>` and `owntube://channel/<id>`.
  - youtube.com / youtu.be / m.youtube.com intent filters (the "open with"
    chooser), mapped the same way the web middleware maps YouTube URLs.
  - Handled in `Shell` next to the existing `owntube://search`.
- **Watch Next row** (Android TV home screen "Continue watching"): publish
  in-progress videos to `TvContractCompat.WatchNextPrograms` on progress and
  exit, and remove them on completion. It needs a small Kotlin module
  (androidx.tvprovider); the deep link above is the program intent.
- **Home screen channel** (optional): a "Subscriptions" preview channel
  refreshed on app start.
- **MediaSession metadata:** title, channel and artwork on the now-playing
  card and for Assistant ("pause", "skip 30 seconds"). Check what expo-video
  already sets; add the metadata if it's missing.
- **Send to TV** (the OwnTube equivalent of casting / "Link with TV code"):
  - Server: a `remote` channel keyed by user and device (device id taken
    from the pairing token), with procedures `devices.list` and
    `remote.sendToDevice(videoId, t)`.
  - TV: poll every 2 s while in the foreground, as pairing already does, or
    use SSE if the tRPC setup allows it. Open the video with its context.
  - Web: a "Play on TV" button on `/watch` when the user has a paired device.
  - This is the only phase-5 item that needs backend work.

**As built:**
- Deep links: `lib/deep-links.ts`.
  - Handles `owntube://watch|channel|search`, plus YouTube
    watch / shorts / live / embed / youtu.be / playlist / channel / @handle /
    c / user / results URLs, with `t` given as seconds, `90s` or `1m30s`.
  - `app.json` intentFilters register youtube.com, m./www./music.youtube.com
    and youtu.be, so the TV shows up in "Open with".
  - A playlist link plays the playlist through.
- Watch Next: a local Expo module (`modules/watch-next`, Kotlin,
  androidx.tvprovider).
  - On leaving a video between 3 % and 95 % it upserts a `WATCH_NEXT_TYPE_CONTINUE`
    program keyed by video id, whose intent is `owntube://watch?v=…`.
  - On playToEnd, or past 95 %, it removes the program.
- The optional home-screen "Subscriptions" channel was skipped.
- MediaSession metadata: title, channel and artwork go in expo-video's
  `metadata` on every source.
- Send to TV:
  - Server: `server/tv-remote.ts` and the `tvRemote` router. An in-memory
    registry per user: TVs poll every 2.5 s (`tvRemote.poll`) with an id they
    generate and keep on the device, since device tokens carry no device id.
    The poll marks the TV present for 30 s and collects a pending video.
  - Web: a "Play on <TV>" pill on the watch page's action row. It sends the
    current position and pauses the page's player.
- Verified on the emulator:
  - A youtu.be link with `t=90` opened the video at 1:30.
  - The media session showed the title and channel.
  - The half-watched video appeared in the launcher's Play Next row.
  - A send through `tvRemote.sendToDevice` opened the video at 0:30 on the
    TV.
- Not verified: the web button in a browser; its call was exercised
  directly instead.

## Phase 6 — depth

- **Description and comments panel** on the watch screen (`video.detail`
  description, `video.comments` top/new with paging). Read-only and
  focusable, with D-pad scrolling.
- **Live polish:**
  - A LIVE badge.
  - "Go to live" when 15 s or more behind the edge, matching the web's
    threshold.
  - Seeking within the DVR window.
  - Post-live DVR through the `/dash` fallback, as on the web.
  - Upcoming-stream state with the start time.
- **Error states:** age-restricted, unavailable and upcoming, each with a
  retry button, mirroring the web's watch page.
- **Shorts:**
  - A vertical player where up/down moves between shorts.
  - Feeds from `shorts.feed`, with `shorts.markSeen` for seen-tracking.
  - A Shorts row on Home when the web home has the shelf.
- **Profiles ("Who's watching"):** keep several paired accounts on one TV
  (a token per profile) and switch between them from Settings or at start.
- **Recommendation feedback:** "Not interested" and "Don't recommend
  channel" (`interactions.set` ignore, `blockRecommendationChannel`).

**As built:**
- Description and comments: `components/DetailsPanel.tsx`, opened from the
  player's ⓘ button.
  - Paragraphs and comments are focusable blocks, so the D-pad scrolls
    through them.
  - Comments come Top or Newest first, with More.
  - Upstream comment HTML is shown as plain text.
- Errors: `video.detail` now maps upcoming → `PRECONDITION_FAILED`, with
  `premiereTimestamp` added by a new tRPC `errorFormatter`, and unavailable
  → `NOT_FOUND`. Age-restricted was already `UNPROCESSABLE_CONTENT`.
  - The TV shows "Not started yet" (with the start time; retries every
    minute), "Age-restricted", "Video unavailable" or the generic message.
  - Retry is offered where it can help.
- Live polish:
  - A LIVE badge.
  - "Go live" at 15 s or more behind the edge, via
    `player.currentOffsetFromLive`.
  - Scrubbing uses the player's DVR duration.
  - Post-live DVR needs nothing extra, because the server's DASH route
    already falls back to the companion's manifest.
- Shorts:
  - A Shorts section with a portrait player: Up/Down change shorts, OK
    pauses, focus is pinned vertically, each short is marked seen after 2 s.
  - A Shorts row on Recommended, which is where the web shows its shelf.
    Home blocks have no Shorts type.
- Profiles:
  - `lib/auth-token.ts` keeps one token per profile, each under its own
    SecureStore key; the active one stays under the old key.
  - Profiles are labelled from a new `auth.me` procedure.
  - "Who's watching" appears at start with more than one profile, and from
    Settings → Switch or add profile.
  - Sign out removes only the active profile. Changing server removes them
    all.
- Recommendation feedback: Not interested and Don't recommend channel, in
  the card menu (phase 3) and the player's settings panel.
- Verified on the emulator:
  - The unavailable screen.
  - The description and comments panel.
  - The Shorts player, including Up/Down with focus pinned.
  - "Who's watching", with the email label.
- Not exercised: an upcoming or age-restricted video, a live stream's
  Go live, and adding a second profile.

## Cross-cutting rules

- **D-pad first.** Every new surface must be fully usable with arrows, OK
  and Back, and Back always closes the innermost layer. Test each surface on
  the emulator before committing.
- **Text inputs** use `FocusableTextInput`. A bare `TextInput` cannot take
  D-pad focus on Android.
- **Server truth:** settings changed on the TV go through `settings.update`,
  so the web and TV stay the same. Device-local choices (sidebar order,
  caption language, recent searches) stay in SecureStore or local storage.
- **Mirror, don't fork, policy:** reuse `@web/lib/*` helpers (chapters, scrub
  frames, quality labels, short detection) as `WatchScreen` already does,
  rather than reimplementing them.
- **Verification per phase:** typecheck (compare against the known `@web`
  baseline errors), `biome check`, release build, and install and drive it on
  the Android TV emulator with screenshots.

## Rough sizing

| phase | size | backend changes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | S (½ day) | none |
| 1 | M (2–3 days) | none |
| 2 | M–L (3–4 days) | none |
| 3 | L (4–5 days) | maybe a cursor on `listSidebar` |
| 4 | M (2–3 days) | optional update manifest |
| 5 | L (4–6 days) | Send to TV (`remote`/device procedures) |
| 6 | L (5+ days) | none |

Phases 1 and 2 give the largest user-visible improvement per day. Phase 4
blocks sharing the app with anyone else; do it before phase 5 if that matters
sooner.
